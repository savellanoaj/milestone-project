        <p> Goku has always been one to get into fights in his childhood, he had to to survive pretty much after his caretaker passed. 
        Goku over time met stronger and powerful people, eventually it became his thing and his arguable greatest interest</p>
        <br>
        <p> Goku has always been one to eat a LOT, Goku raised by grandpa gohan was also another reason why Goku is a kind person and is a person who wants to help if he can.</p>
        <br>
        <p> And so Goku has a reckless persona when he views anyone strong to fight, eagerly wanting to battle them.
        Although Goku is a fighter he is and has shown his pacifist self, Often avoiding killing his enemies and even giving them a chance, as with vegeta and piccolo</p>
