            <form action="" class="one-a">Goku's biggest Hobby is his competitive side, challenging opponents and training.

                This being Goku's biggest hobby is a clear one to see, being something he loves to do and is probably always doing. 
                
                When Goku is not fighting he is spending his time with family and friends. Goku loves to joke around with his companions.
