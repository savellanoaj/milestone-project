        <h2>Goku Hobbies</h2>

            <form action="" class="one-a">Goku's biggest Hobby is his competitive side, challenging opponents and
                training.

                This being Goku's biggest hobby is a clear one to see, being something he loves to do and is probably
                always doing.

                When Goku is not fighting he is spending his time with family and friends. Goku loves to joke around
                with his companions.

            </form>

            <p>Goku has a big appetite for food, being a huge eater. To fuel himself for his training/spars/fights etc. it is necessary for him to fill himself up.
            Eating is another big hobby of Goku when not fighting/challenging people.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Goku has also previously fished and may even fish sometimes now as well.
            When Goku was younger he had fished in the wild and this was one hobby of his.</p>
