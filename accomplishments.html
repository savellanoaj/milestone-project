        <h2>Ultra Instinct</h2>
        <div class="ultra">
            <form action="" class="one-a">Goku obtained this power during the Tournament of Power. On the verge of
                defeat that would
                have wiped the
                whole univers. Goku managed to overcome hardship and unlocked this new
                power hidden about to rival gods. Goku managed to turn the tables and win his brawl with his foe after
                his
                accomplishment of Ultra Instinct.

                It was through sheer willpower and concentration that Goku managed to reach this point. Furthermore,
                Goku
                even enhances this new found power and makes it even stronger. This form allows Goku.

        <h2>Befriending A God</h2>
        <div class="ultra">
            <form action="" class="one-a">Goku in his Universe became affiliated and created a friendly relationship
                with a God of Destruction.
                It was through Goku's brilliant and outstanding fighting spirit and will to protect he came across the
                God of Destruction.
                After an epic brawl with a God of Destruction, Goku while defeated, earned the God of Destruction's
                respect.
                The God of Destruction, Beerus, now has many conversations with Goku with jokes and laughs.
                One of many Goku's accomplishments, Befriending a God is one to remember.
