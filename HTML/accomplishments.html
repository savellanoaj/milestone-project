            <form action="" class="one-a">Goku obtained this power during the Tournament of Power. On the verge of defeat that would
                have wiped the
                whole univers. Goku managed to overcome hardship and unlocked this new
                power hidden about to rival gods. Goku managed to turn the tables and win his brawl with his foe after
                his
                accomplishment of Ultra Instinct.

                It was through sheer willpower and concentration that Goku managed to reach this point. Furthermore,
                Goku
                even enhances this new found power and makes it even stronger. This form allows Goku.
