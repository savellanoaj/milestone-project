        <h2>Goku Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="ultra">
            <form action="" class="one-a">Goku's biggest Hobby is his competitive side, challenging opponents and
                training.

                This being Goku's biggest hobby is a clear one to see, being something he loves to do and is probably
                always doing.

                When Goku is not fighting he is spending his time with family and friends. Goku loves to joke around
                with his companions.
